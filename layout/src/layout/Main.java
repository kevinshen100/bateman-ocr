/**
 * A basic Java GUI application
 * <p />
 * This uses a <emph>pull</emph> version of Model-View-Controller: i.e. it does not use events and listeners to
 * communicate changes from the model to the view or controller.
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *       The model does not know anything about the view or the controller
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       The view reads from but NEVER updates the model. Instead it calls methods on the controller to
 *       carry out such operations.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       The controller gets called by the view when a user interaction occurs, calls methods on the model to update
 *       as necessary and calls methods on the view to trigger the appropriate changes in the GUI.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       The utils package contains utility classes that can be used by any classes.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       The model, view and controller packages each have only ONE public class: the class of the corresponding
 *       (capitalized) name. All other classes in these packages have package scope (i.e. no Public modifier), and
 *       hence cannot be seen by any classes in other packages.
 *   </li>
